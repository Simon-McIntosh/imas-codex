# Neo4j Configuration
# Named graph profiles allow switching between instances at runtime.
# IMAS_CODEX_GRAPH selects the active profile (iter, tcv, jt60sa, etc.)
# Each profile maps to convention-based ports (iter=7687, tcv=7688, etc.)
# Priority: IMAS_CODEX_GRAPH env → pyproject.toml default → "iter"
IMAS_CODEX_GRAPH=iter

# Env var overrides (escape hatches, applied over any profile)
