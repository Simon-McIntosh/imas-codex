# Facility hostname to IP mappings for VPN environments
#
# When working with VPNs that block external DNS, these static mappings
# allow SSH access to work correctly.
#
# Structure:
#   facility_name:
#     - hostname: the FQDN that needs resolution
#       ip: the static IP address
#       comment: optional description
#
# Usage:
#   imas-codex hosts resolve epfl        # Show entries for EPFL
#   imas-codex hosts sync                # Update /etc/hosts with all entries
#   imas-codex hosts check               # Verify DNS resolution

# iter and jet use ITER network, which typically resolves internally
# Only add entries here if VPN blocks ITER DNS too

iter:
  # Add if ITER DNS is blocked

jet:
  # JET is accessed via ITER reverse tunnel, no direct DNS needed
