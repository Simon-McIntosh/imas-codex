  signal_naming: >-
    TDI function dispatch: tcv_eq('quantity', source='LIUQE'),
    tcv_get('signal_name'), or direct functions like fir_aut(shot).
    Raw MDSplus paths use backslash notation: \tree::subtree:node.

    MDSplus subtrees: ATLAS, BASE, DIAGZ, DIAG_ACT, ECRH, HYBRID,
    MAGNETICS, MANUAL, POWER, RESULTS, VSYSTEM, PCS, APCS.
    TDI subdirs at /usr/local/CRPP/tdi/: base, devices, python,
    scopes, tcv, trees, vsystem. TDI functions abstract over
    MDSplus trees with automatic path resolution.
